 The proposed technology is designed to identify specific types of vehicles, such as ambulances and firetrucks, and notify nearby
 services.It aims to alert relevant authorities like RTO officers for better coordination and allow people on the road to prepare for their
 arrival.This system comprises a processing unit (computer or high-spec microcontroller), cameras for footage capture, and a
 database of number plates for vehicle recognition.
