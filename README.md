 The proposed technology is designed to identify specific types of vehicles, such as ambulances and firetrucks, and notify nearby
 services.It can be helpful to alert relevant authorities like RTO officers for better coordination and allow people on the road to prepare for their
 arrival.The system would comprise a processing unit (computer or high-spec microcontroller), cameras for footage capture, and a
 database of number plates for vehicle recognition.


 Current Functionality: The system processes an image of a vehicle, applies noise removal techniques, and then uses OCR to accurately extract and output the vehicle number as a string.
 
This output can then be cross-referenced with a database of registered vehicle numbers, including emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.
